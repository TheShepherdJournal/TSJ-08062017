The caboose which sits next to the Train Depot recently received a new coat of red paint, and I have to say that it is looking really good. In fact, it looks brand new.

Here are some photos taken while it was being painted:

I've been taking my kids to the Train Depot since my oldest son was a baby. Now it's one of my youngest son's favorite places to visit in Shepherd. I really appreciate the resources and effort that are going into freshening up the look of the caboose.

Not only is a place we spent time at, but I can see the caboose from our house. It really stands out.

What do you think of the caboose's new look? What kinds of thoughts or memories do you have regarding the Train Depot? What other buildings or locations do you think should be cleaned up or updated?
