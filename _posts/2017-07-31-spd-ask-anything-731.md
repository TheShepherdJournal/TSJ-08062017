<h4>Expressway Speed Limits</h4>
<h4>Q: When the speed limit on US-27 changed to 75 MPH, did the minimum speed limit change also?</h4>
Shepherd Police Department (SPD): No
<h4>Q: Did the speed limit only increase on US-27, or in other places too? What about 75?</h4>
SPD: It changed in different areas. Not sure about 75.
<h3>Self Defense against a home intruder</h3>
<h4>Q: What will happen if someone breaks into a house, and then fires their gun at the home owner and misses. But, the homeowner shoots the intruder with their gun. Would they go to jail?</h4>
SPD: You have the right to protect your life when facing such a situation.
<h4>Q: But it has to be in the house and not out on the porch or lawn is that correct.</h4>
SPD: That portion of the law changed. It now says: Michigan’s Self-Defense Act is often referred to as a ‘Stand Your Ground’ law because, under certain circumstances, you have no legal obligation to retreat from an assailant before using deadly force or non-deadly force against them. To be clear, however, the statute (MCL 780.972) only provides for two specific situations in which you may utilize deadly or non-deadly force with no requirement to retreat:

You “honestly and reasonably” believe that such force is necessary to protect yourself and/or someone else from imminent death or imminent great bodily harm.
You “honestly and reasonably” believe that such force is necessary to protect yourself and/or someone else from imminent sexual assault.
<h3>Funeral Processions</h3>
<h4>Q: What's the law when a funeral procession is coming at you on a two lane road do you have to stop?</h4>
SPD: By law you do not have to stop. Although funeral processions have the right away at all intersections.
<h3>Saving someone from a hot car</h3>
<h4>Q: Can you legally break a window of a car if a person leaves a baby or animal in there during the summer?</h4>
SPD: No, call Central Dispatch and they will send an officer to take care of it. Although, if someone is in despair, every person has to do what they think best. That isn’t giving the okay to smash a window, but every person has to understand that there could be consequences. Worse case scenario, you could be charged with destruction of property.
<h3>Differences between blood alcohol and breath alcohol level</h3>
<h4>Q: When someone is pulled over for a DWI. Is there a difference between and blood alcohol level and a breath alcohol level?</h4>
SPD: Michigan law requires a person to submit to a breath test (we do ours at the jail) or a blood test (done at the hospital). Refusal can result in a suspension of your license.
