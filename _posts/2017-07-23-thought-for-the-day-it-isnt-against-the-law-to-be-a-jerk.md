THOUGHT FOR THE DAY -- It isn't against the law to be a jerk. All across the country, police officers have to tell people this when the they want someone thrown under a jail for saying something mean to them, posting a lie on FB about them or just overall being a jerk.

In a perfect world everyone would follow the mantra from Disney's classic movie Bambi -- if you can't saying something nice, don't say anything at all. But...unfortunately this is not reality.

There is no criminal law pertaining to this subject. A quick flip though tv shows...The People's Court, Judge Judy, Judge Joe Brown and all of the other ones...society has been lead to believe that this is a criminal matter. We have to remember that this is television. Slander is defined as: making false or damaging statements about someone. Having said that, there is not a criminal statute that pertains to it...it is considered a civil matter. Which means that if you wish to pursue action against them you must do it in civil court.

So what do you do when someone is a jerk to you? There are many options, some better than others...and legal too. I just told a person yesterday, sometimes you have to be the bigger person, swallow your pride and JUST IGNORE THEM. I know this isn't the most fun option...or the most satisfying option...I totally understand that. However, why allow them the satisfaction of knowing that they got under your skin, ruined you day or even wasted a second of your day thinking about them?

Again, it's not against the law to be a jerk...but the world would be such a nicer place if there were a few less jerks.
