Shepherd Middle School’s new principal, Ben Brock, will be a familiar face to the community. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jgross811">Jay Gross </a>wrote about Brock’s appointment as SMS principal on his facebook page:
<blockquote>Hey There Shepherd...

A Blue Jay at heart, mind, and soul is coming home...

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/benbrock8?fref=mentions">Ben Brock</a> is returning to Shepherd as middle school principal!

After being principal for about 14 years combined at Port Huron and Carson City Crystal, Ben will bring his family and all that Blue Jay pride back to the nest...

While I was talking to him, he said something that really got me... touched my heart...

"You know G... I have been at two places and keep trying to turn them into Shepherd... make them like home. It just doesn't work. There is no place like Shepherd anywhere else."

Ben is right. There isn't.

So happy and proud to have Ben and his whole family coming home…</blockquote>
According to Brock’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/benbrock8">Facebook profile</a>, he graduated from Shepherd High School in 1996, then graduated from Central Michigan University with a degree in Health and Physical Education in 2001.
