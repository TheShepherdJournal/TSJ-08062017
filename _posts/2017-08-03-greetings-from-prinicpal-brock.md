I hope that you are taking advantage of spending time with your families this summer. I look forward to meeting all of you during the upcoming academic school year as your Principal. I am grateful for this opportunity to work with such great people and my family is very excited to be back in my hometown as I am a proud 1996 SHS graduate.

It will be an honor to help build upon all of the great programs offered to students at Shepherd Middle School. Our goal for this year will be to improve our student achievement through positive relationships, improved instruction, and targeted interventions. There are many challenges that lie ahead of us and I know that we will be ready to attack these in order to provide the best possible experience for your children.

I owe a lot of what I have today due to the great mentors I had while I attended Shepherd Public Schools. My teachers, administrators and coaches I had shaped the kind of person I am today and I could not have asked for a better experience. Thank you for trusting us to educate your child. There's no better time than now to be a Blue Jay!!
Go Jays,
Benjamin R. Brock
