The public is invited to attend a presentation being hosted by the Stone Lodge Memory Care inside the Shepherd Community Library on Monday, June 26 at 6 p.m. regarding plans to build a Men’s Shed on its property.

During the presentation, guest speaker and dementia specialist Stuart Torrence will talk about the history of the Men’s Shed, how it can help dementia patients and the process for bringing the concept to Shepherd.

Stone Lodge Memory Care owner Mary Jo Gibbons said that the Men’s Shed has grown in popularity in the UK and in Australia, but is still a new concept in the United States. Gibbons describes it as a space inside an actual shed where men suffering dementia can work on different projects or hobbies of their choosing, while surrounded by friendly faces.

Gibbons says that the shed would be built next to the facility’s enclosed patio. Volunteers are needed to help with both the construction of the structure and to assist attendees during the day. Part of the discussion on Monday during the presentation will center around the need for help with the creation of a Men’s Shed in Shepherd.
