One event I’ve been looking forward to is the Farm to Table Dinner, which will be held on August 10 starting at 6 p.m. in front of the Shepherd Post Office. From the images that I’ve seen on the Farm to Table <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shepherdfarmtotable/">Facebook page</a> and <a href="http://shepherdfarmtotable.com/">website</a>, I can understand that this will involve a long table where everybody will sit at as they eat dinner, but it is the kind of event that you really have to experience first hand.

Tickets are $25 a piece, and are available for purchase from committee members as well as several businesses including Mitchell’s Gourmet Deli, Shepherd Bar, and Marrita’s. The dinner is a fundraiser, and proceeds will go towards the St. Vincent De Paul Food pantry.
<h2>Fresh and Locally grown</h2>
Another aspect of the dinner which makes it special is that all of the food served will be made from fresh ingredients which have been grown locally. This includes:
<h3>Appetizers</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Focaccia</li>
 	<li>Sausage Starters</li>
 	<li>Fruit Kabobs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Salad</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Caprese Salad</li>
 	<li>Cucumber Salad</li>
</ul>
<h3>Main Course</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Local Farm-raised Chicken with a house-made Rosemary Maple Glaze</li>
 	<li>Roasted Medallions of Pork Tenderloin with fresh fruit salsa</li>
 	<li>Grilled Bi-Color Sweet Corn with an assortment of Tasty Toppings</li>
 	<li>Savory Roasted Root Vegetables</li>
 	<li>Perfectly Crisp Tender Green Beans</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dessert</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Maple Cake Pops</li>
 	<li>Razzy Raspberry Dessert</li>
 	<li>Fresh Summer Fruit Cobbler with Vanilla Ice Cream</li>
</ul>
Overall, this is a delicious sounding event which will raise money for a good cause.
<h2>Entertainment and other Extras</h2>
In addition to Dinner, there will be live music provided by Tinker Folly, door prizes, and a silent auction.
