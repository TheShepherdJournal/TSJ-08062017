On Saturday I published an article about Brian Henson’s announcement that he was retiring, and that his hardware would be closing. “After 52 years of selling hardware, the last 34 in Shepherd, I have decided to try a new career better known as retirement,” He wrote on his Facebook page profile, “It is with regret that I leave the many loyal people who have chosen to become not just customers but friends.”
There has been a lot of reaction to the news of Brian’s retirement. Of the 38 people who <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shepherdjournal/posts/10155197272360921">responded via emoticons to the article on Facebook</a>, 21 responded with sad faces, 15 responded with thumbs up, and two have responded with shocked faces.
“I suppose he deserves retirement but the hardware store was always the place you find what you needed even if you didn’t know what it was! Someone could figure out what a”doo-hickey" was…and order it from a catalog. Sorry to see it close…and we don’t even live in Shepherd any more," wrote Mary Jaquith.
Julie Bixby wrote, “Appreciate your years of service. You will truly be missed. Wishing you all the best! Enjoy!”
“Sad about the store closing. . . . happy for you Brian!! Congrats!!!” wrote Brenda Veit.

There were several who reminisced about past visits to the store and commented on how its closing impacted the community.
“Awww, how sad! I remember making many trips in there w/ my Daddy when I was a little girl,” wrote Janiece Shattuck Cooper.
“What a sad story.. I remember coming to Sheperd as a child and being enchanted with the many small stores and uniqueness of the small town , I’m saddened by all the empty buildings and businesses closing,” wrote Pattie Kay Whitmore.
“So sad . . . seems like my little town keeps getting a little smaller! I have been going to this hardware store my entire life as did my parents,” wrote Nancy S. Kellicut.
