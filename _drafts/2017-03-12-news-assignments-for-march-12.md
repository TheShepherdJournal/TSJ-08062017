I have three story assignments for anybody who is interested.
<h3>Hanson Hardware</h3>

There has been a lot of interest in the quick story that I published about Hanson Hardware's closure. The article can be seen here: <a href="http://www.shepherdhistory.org/hanson-hardware-closing/">http://www.shepherdhistory.org/hanson-hardware-closing/</a>

I would like to run a story summarizing the reactions from readers, as well as a response from Brian Hanson and updates. I know that the closing sale is still on-going.

I think that this is important enough to go in depth, either with a video interview, profile, etc. Photos showing the history of the business would also be great.
<h3>Egg Scramble</h3>

The Shepherd Chamber Egg Scramble is coming up April 15. I am looking for someone who would be interested in covering the event with an article about it beforehand and a summary afterwards describing what happened. This could be written as a straight article, or as more of a blog entry from your own perspective as a parent, or told from the perspective of your participating child.

This is a great opportunity for a photo gallery, so if you're free that morning, or if you're attending, consider taking a few photos and contributing them to the Shepherd Journal. Or, if you have a photo of your child scrambling for eggs you'd like to share, let me know.
<h3>Maple Leafs</h3>

Businesses and individuals will be decorating and setting out Maple Leafs again this year. I am looking for coverage in terms of who is participating, what are their design ideas, photos of the leafs after they are completed, and what happens during the silent auction which will follow. A photo gallery showing the completed leafs would be great.

This year, if itâ€™s possible it would be great to be able to get photos of the leafs next to the artist and/or the business owner who decorated it.
