The work is still ongoing for the new playscape area next to the baseball diamonds and the Shepherd Trail. Cement has been laid down around the space where the equipment was installed, and there are large piles of shredded rubber which is waiting to be evened out.

The installation of the playscape was a project initiated by Jeanneane Nartker who wanted to create a safe space for kids to play during baseball games. The playground is designed to be accessible.

The $150,000 project was made possible through the help of donors and volunteers. The playscape was initially installed entirely by volunteers. Donors include the Mount Pleasant Community Foundation, Rollin M. Gerstacker Foundation, Home Run Derby, Christopher and Dana Reeves Foundation, and the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival committee.
