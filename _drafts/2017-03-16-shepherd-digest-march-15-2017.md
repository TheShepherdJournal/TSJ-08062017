<i>The Morning Sun</i> covered the <a href="http://www.themorningsun.com/general-news/20170314/maple-syrup-weekend-coming-saturday-and-sunday-to-shepherd-blanchard">Sugar Bush’s open house scheduled from 10 a.m until 4 p.m. this weekend</a>. The open house is a part of the Michigan Maple Syrup Association’s Fifth Annual Maple Weekend event.
<blockquote>“The goal of the weekend is to get people into their (sugar) bushes where they are,” said volunteer Merrie Hammel, who volunteers with her husband Arnie Hammel at Shepherd Sugar Bush
. . .
Visitors to Shepherd Sugar Bush will be able to see the steps of maple syrup production, and a display will also be set up to show the modern method of sap collecting by tubing as utilized in the Winn Woods.</blockquote>

<h2>Story Assignments 03/15/2017</h2>
<h3>Shepherd BPA</h3>

It would be great to get the results of the competition, a few pictures, and a list of the students who attended the competition.
<h3>SHS 2017 Top Ten</h3>
<a href="https://trello.com/c/WCMLN9Tx">https://trello.com/c/WCMLN9Tx</a>

Looking for photos that can be run next to each students’ name. Could just be a gallery or a spread.
<h3>SES Science Fair</h3>
<a href="https://trello.com/c/vvbLaUBZ">https://trello.com/c/vvbLaUBZ</a>

I would like to run a retrospective on the Shepherd Elementary School’s Science Fair. Some ideas:
<ul>
 	<li>Student describes their science project and/or writes about their experience attending the science fair</li>
 	<li>Photos of science projects which earned first place ribbons</li>
</ul>
If the students needed to write descriptions of their science projects, then it might be possible to run a few of those with photos.
