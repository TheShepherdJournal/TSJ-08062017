FALL 2017 REGISTRATION IS NOW OPEN FOR 1st-8th GRADE SOCCER!

To register, go to the <a href="leagues.bluesombrero.com/shepherdsoccer">Shepherd Soccer Club Sign up site</a>. You will have to create an account for this website but we believe that it will make the registration process run much more smoothly.

Cost/Deadline: $35/player The registration deadline is JULY 29TH. Under no circumstances will late registration be accepted.

Tentative season dates:
<ul>
 	<li>7/29: Soccer Clinic</li>
 	<li>Mid-August: Coaches to contact players/start practices</li>
 	<li>9/9: First game</li>
 	<li>10/21: Last game and end of year party</li>
</ul>
