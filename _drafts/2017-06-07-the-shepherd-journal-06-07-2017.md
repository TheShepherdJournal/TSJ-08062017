<h4>Shepherd Middle School Graduation</h4>

On Monday, I watched an impressive group of students wrap up the eighth grade with an award ceremony. The choir sang, the band played, and plenty of awards were handed out. As I listened to the names being called off, I thought about how much work it takes to complete three years of middle school, and how these same students would be beginning a new chapter in their lives next year when they attended the high school as freshmen.
