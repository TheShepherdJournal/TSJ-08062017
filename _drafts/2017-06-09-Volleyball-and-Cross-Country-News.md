<p>Shepherd Middle School:Â 

Attention all sixth and seventh graders: If you are interested in playing volleyball or running cross country in the fall you can still sign up in the middle school office. Please leave your name and email address so the coach can contact you over the summer. Your first practice is Monday, August 21st. Practice times will be determined at a later date and posted on facebook and will also be sent out via a powerschool announcement.
