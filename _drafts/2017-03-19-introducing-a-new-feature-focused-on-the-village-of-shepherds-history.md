Every so often, History Mystery will explore aspects of Shepherd's past, and publish answers to questions about Shepherd's history which have been submitted by readers.

You can respond with a question in the comments, or send email to <a href="mailto:editor@shepherdhistory.org">editor@shepherdhistory.org</a>. Questions will be researched and then featured in future editions of History Mystery. I also welcome guest writers who would like to share memories, or offer insight.
