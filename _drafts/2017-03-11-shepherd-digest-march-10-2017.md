<h3>Shepherd Middle School Can Drive Update</h3>
Via the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sms.shepherdmi/posts/1172200549556124">Shepherd Middle School</a>

Here are pictures of the middle school’s final results! SMS bought in 2108 food items. They earned the mystery surprise and won the staff challenge! Also, amazingly, even though the middle school has fewer students they were able to beat the high school, who had an impressive 1642 items. That is a total of 3750 items that will go to the food pantry at the Salvation Army. Thank you for being part of the effort to help the community! This is what being a Shepherd Bluejay is all about!

<h3>Shepherd Middle School offers new Food assistance Program</h3>

Shepherd Middle School has a new food assistance program that can help meet needs over breaks from school, or other times of need. During the week before break, we will be offering an opportunity for parents to come fill a box of food to take home, or to send small bags of food home with students. If you have a specific need, we will do our best to meet requests.

If this is something that could be helpful for your family, please contact the Middle School counseling office by March 22nd to be sure that we can meet your needs. This program is supported by community donations and funding by the Mt. Pleasant Area Community Foundation.
