I am looking for more information about the lockin at the Shepherd Middle School that's coming up on February 3. Also, I am looking for "correspondants," most likely middle schoolers, who are planning on attending the event and could write about their thoughts or experiences prior or following the event.

You can use the "Share a Story" shown at the bottom of this page, or send an email to <a href="mailto:editor@shepherdhistory.org">editor@shepherdhistory.org</a>. <a href="https://www.penflip.com/shepherdonlinehq/sms-lockin?invite=Ds92KEax">You can also add to the project here</a>.

Here are some questions to help guide your submission:

* Are you planning on attending?
* If yes, which activities are you most looking forward to?
