Local playwright Diana Luehm researched Abraham Lincoln for three years in order to write a play that honors his life. The historical play To Be a Lincoln will be premiering at Shepherd High School Auditorium for the general public the first weekend of March (Saturday, March 4th at 3:00 and 7:00 and Sunday, March 5th at 3:00). <span style="font-size: 19.552px;">Tickets at the door are eight dollars, which can be purchased with a check or cash.</span>

<span style="font-size: 19.552px;">The main plot of the play is based on an interesting historical fact. Both Robert Todd Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth dated the same girl at the same time: Lucy Hale who was the daughter of abolitionist Senator John Hale. Much to her parents’ dismay, Lucy rejected Robert Todd to seek the affection of the famous actor Booth. </span>

<span style="font-size: 19.552px;">Besides this love triangle, the play has two playful children, the burning of the White House barn, the assassination of Lincoln, and an appeal by the wounded Seward to pursue Lincoln’s goal of finishing “the great task that remains before us.”Good family entertainment, the play is an hour and fifteen minutes long. Come see the play that entertains, teaches, and inspires.</span>
