From <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jgross811">Jay Gross</a>:
<blockquote>Okay...

Learned tonight...

I am going on a diet...losing weight... and starting to walk again...

Coughing from laughing...and running...

Jake and Jordan saw it... Goob missed it but they went back with sticks in their hands to find it... and NO Bigfoot research kit or camera!

They are convinced it's Dad...

Sooooo... I think Uncle Mike will be making an appearance soon as Bigfoot's brother...

I shot a bit more on my way in... Jo didn't shoot anything while trying to drive...

In bed now... still coughing... but chuckling every now and then...</blockquote>
