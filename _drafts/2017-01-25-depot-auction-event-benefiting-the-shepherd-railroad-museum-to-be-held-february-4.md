<em>Editor's Note: This is a re-post of an article which went live earlier this month.</em>

An auction event will be held inside the Shepherd Maple Room from 3-6 p.m. on Saturday, February 4 to benefit the Shepherd Railroad Museum. According to an article published in <em>The Village Messenger</em>:
<blockquote>This event includes a Silent Auction that runs the whole time and a Live Auction beginning at 4 p.m. The auction is held to raise funds to help maintain the historical buildings and railroad cars at the Shepherd Depot.</blockquote>
The Depot Committee, which is hosting the event, is asking for donations of either items which can be auctioned off or checks/cash. The committee has also obtained a 501(c)(3) which allows it to apply for grants. “We are proud to announce we have received a grant from the Mt. Pleasant Area Community Foundation for paint for the caboose and a second grant to replace windows before we paint,” the article in the <em>Messenger</em> reported. The committee also thanked the community for their support of the maintenance of Shepherd’s historical Depot Museum and railroad cars.
