The Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival is seeking volunteers who are interested in coordinating two popular traditional events, and one brand-new event that is being introduced during this year's Festival:
<ul>
 	<li>Queen/Royalty Pageant</li>
 	<li>Princess Pageant</li>
 	<li>Talent/Variety Show</li>
</ul>
The Royalty and the Princess Pageant are two very important events which have been made a part of the Festival tradition during the last few years. The Talent/Variety represents an opportunity to expand upon the list of events during the Festival.

Anybody who is interested is welcomed to contact Pete Alexander, SMSF Committee President, at <a href="tel:9898285422">(989) 828-5422</a>Â or <a href="tel:9899443311">(989) 944-3311</a>. Or, send email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@shepherdmaplesyrupfest.org">webmaster@shepherdmaplesyrupfest.org</a>.
