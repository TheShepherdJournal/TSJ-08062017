<b>Jay Gross: </b>Hey There Shepherd...

I just want to give a HUGE shout out to our School Improvement Team and Danielle Marsh.

Last night the Oscar's Night was held and was really pretty cool. The high school students voted on awards... students presented... Michael Willett and Mike Halliwell were the MC's... the J Jazz performed lead by JoAnn Rahl-Gross...
We even had entertainment by students that was just plain awesome!
And are you ready for this? The high school staff performed a dance number centered around our own Mr. Ross Austin as (are you ready for this?) Bruno Mars!!!

Carrie Winn Gauthier's heartfelt thank you at the end capped it off so very well...
I left feeling really good... really proud to be a part of this school... community...
And looking to next year being even bigger and better!

Way to ROCK it Blue Jays!!!

PS. I have the entire video on my FB page if you want a peek at it.
