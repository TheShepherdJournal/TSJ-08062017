<b>Jay Gross:</b> I need some help...

I have a professional photographer who contacted me to offer FREE Senior Pictures to a child living in Mt. Pleasant or Shepherd who is in foster care or low income and doesn't have access or means to getting them done...

All I have to have is a name and contact information. Just message me...

So amazingly kind... so very kind...
