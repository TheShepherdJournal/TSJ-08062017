Just maybe…

Been reflecting on my past week at the MACUL Conference 2017…

I came home with so much energy, positive energy… ready to take it back in the classroom and share with my students…

And it is due to the people I hang out with at MACUL and other times around this state…

Ben Gilpin you started my Conference off with a loud bang early Wednesday morning with our chat! The fact you even consider me to keynote your conference is honor enough Sir!

Matinga Ragatz you make me smile… make me feel so good just to be able to be in your presence…

Michael Medvinsky your passion and energy is so very contagious… loved chatting with you and spending some time…

Aric Foster your kind comments and a big ole hug made my day!

Having an incredibly fun lunch with Ben Brock, Tim Sanchez, Keri Leonard Brock, and others was awesome! Catching up and talking education has never been better… even the parts about James Nelson!!

Leslie Fisher you blew my mind (again) with your knowledge and the way you have so much fun doing it! You will always be one of my idols…

Jo Cherry taking a chance on letting me present to your MSTA again meant the world to me!

And I had Craig Kuhn right there for laughs and support again! Thanks Sir!

Melinda Chard Waffle though our conversation was short, just seeing you and that ever present smile….well… my belief in life is again burning solid…

Anne Despres-Thorp… my dear friend… anytime I spend with you makes me a better person… and life more fun!

And Gina L (Loveless)… wow… been trying to find the words… knowing you is one thing positive… (and your hubby is pretty cool too!) but you and the MACUL Executive Board choosing me for the MACUL Making IT Happen Award for 2017 …

Finding the words to show what it means to me will come… and you will be the first to know what an overflowing heart of thanks sounds like…

So very very honored. And I promise to continue to live up to it!

There were many others I bumped into or had a quick chat with… and each overwhelmed me with positives and sharing kind words…

I thank each and every one of you…

Sessions were so full of useful ideas and items….

Professional development does NOT have to be a boring, tedious thing… it can be amazing.

And MACUL puts on one of the very BEST in the country… and possibly the world.

So proud to be a part of it! And I am a better teacher and person for it…

So maybe… just maybe… I am doing something right now and then.
