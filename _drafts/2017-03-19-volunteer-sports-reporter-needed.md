I am looking for someone who would be willing to compile information about local sports, and report on the results of key games. Would be best if they were a Shepherd resident, but I'm open to anybody in the Mid-Michigan area who is a sports enthusiast and would be interested in writing sports stories which focus on Shepherd.

You would need to join a community of contributors and file your stories using a tool called Penflip.

I would need someone who is a strong writer, and is knowledgeable about sports. Experience as a sports reporter isn't critical; I'd be happy to work with a middle or high school student who is interested in getting into the field of writing.

I can't offer financial compensation but this would be a good way to get involved in news reporting, social media management, and/or publishing.

If you're interested, respond with a comment or send email to editor@shepherdhistory.org.
