<p>This year, we have a great schedule of events planned for this year’s Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival taking place April 27-30.  We will once again offer the events that have become festival staples: Arts & Craft Show, Pancake Dinners, Carnival, Old Car Show, Community Dance, and Tractor Pulls.</p>
<p>The Flea Market, an event we introduced last year, will be returning for 2017. A brand-new event we’ve added to the schedule and which will take place on Saturday afternoon is the Demolition Derby. This was very popular during our Party in the Park this past summer, so we’re excited to bring it back to Shepherd for the Festival.</p>
<p>For the kids, we will be offering fun games and clowns as a part of a Children’s Village inside the Shepherd Elementary School, 4H Petting Zoo, and pony rides. As usual, the festival will be kicked off with Buddy Nite on Thursday, and wrapped up with the parade on Sunday.</p>
<p>Visitors will also be able to experience a taste of Shepherd’s heritage by stopping by the Shepherd Sugar Bush, or touring our three museums: The Little Red Schoolhouse, the Powerhouse Museum, and the vintage Train Depot.</p>
<p>It is always a huge thrill to see everyone come together, whether they are contributing as volunteers or here to enjoy the many events that we offer during the Festival. No matter who you are, either resident, or visitor, young, or old, there is something for everybody.</p>
<p>I hope that you will join us for the 59th Annual Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival April 27-30.</p>
