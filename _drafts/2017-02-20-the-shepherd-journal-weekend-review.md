<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a </span><a href="http://flip.it/xpMmA9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highlight of stories and information shared via Facebook over the last few days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The links are presented inside a platform I’ve used in the past called Flipboard. It is accessible on the web, but the mobile app version works even better. The Flipboard app is free, and you will get updates on your phone when new links are added. And, I am planning on adding additional links.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you see something that you feel should be shared in the Flipboard version of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shepherd Journal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, send the link or news tip to </span><a href="mailto:editor@shepherdhistory.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">editor@shepherdhistory.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can also use the “Contact Us” link on the Facebook page to submit information.</span>
