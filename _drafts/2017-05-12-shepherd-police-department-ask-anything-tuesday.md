<b>Shepherd Police Department:</b> Good morning! Before we get to ASK ANYTHING TUESDAY, there are a few things I'd like to quickly go over....

Thank you for your support in viewing and sharing our 3 videos from yesterday and the 9&amp;10 News story. Due to your vigilance they have reached almost 72,000 people (I know some are duplicates) and have been shared almost 1,100 times. We will find this person!

I say this with all kindness, but our primary goal in posting the videos was to have people view and share them. However, some people took the opportunity to bash the owners...when they had limited knowledge of the incidents (remember, our Department didn't release all of the information we had). Hindsight is always 20/20, but we are playing the hand we have been dealt.

Also, we had many well-meaning people who became detectives and suggested we dust for fingerprints, do a stakeout, check various locations for the plants...which are all great ideas, but those are things we have already explored. Since I assume many of you have never dusted for fingerprints...let me tell you that it looks much easier on television...especially in a very humid greenhouse. Just like to Lone Ranger shooting the gun out of the bad guys hand, the stuff you see on CSI is all television magic.

Again, this is all said with the understanding that everyone is trying to help...so please do not take it personally or the wrong way. We are following up on tips that have come in and ask that they keep coming in.

With that....it is ASK ANYTHING TUESDAY! This is your chance to ask any law enforcement related question you may have. Ready, Set, Go...............................

<b>Tim Henn</b> What the law on boom boxes in vehicles? Seeing that my house shakes when they drive by.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Shepherd Police Department </b>Could be a possible noise ordinance violation.
<b>Nancy Scovill</b> Could that be enforced?
<b>Shepherd Police Department</b> It is easier with an ordinance, but the issue becomes what is too loud? You could ask 10 people and get 10 different answers.
<b>Tim Henn </b>http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(20gkr1ymetx3t42o4jtdw5f0))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&amp;objectname=mcl-257-707c&amp;query=on&amp;highlight=Muffler</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Casey Smith</b> What about when they have their ridiculous systems up at 12am and it wakes my kids up and then they park facing the wrong way on the street?
<b>Shepherd Police Department</b> Also, no agency I know of has a decibel meter to determine what level of noise a vehicle is putting out. I'd contact your local police agency Casey Smith.
<b>Nancy Scovill</b> I would think that would be to loud.</p>
<b>Sandi Hoover</b> Just on the fingerprint thing. Did they try getting a finger print off the inside of the handle on the outside of the door where she pulled it shut? Now to my question. If your driving down a road that has single yellow lines and double yellow lines even though you can see the sign that says no passing is it legal to start to pass a car before you get to the yellow line and continue driving even though you know you can't see what is coming at you and I know darn well that they seen the sign
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Shepherd Police Department</b> They, would be our Department, and we could not get a print. Fingerprinting is so touch to get a good one...especially on a door that hundreds of people have used. Also, contrary to tv...unless someone has their prints on record in Lansing they could not be matched anyway. I believe i understand what you are describing and that would be illegal.
<b>Sandi Hoover</b> Thank you that is what I thought</p>
&nbsp;

<b>Amanda Harvey </b>In a domestic dispute call is there a mandated law saying that someone has to go to jail? Or does is vary by county?
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Shepherd Police Department</b> No mandated law that I am aware of.
<b>Shepherd Police Department </b>However...if an assault has taken place, someone is most likely going to jail.</p>
<b>Nikkita Marie</b> What is the law on a booster seat with and without a back on it for a child under the age of 4 that only weighs 31 pounds and that's fully dressed with shoes on?
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Shepherd Police Department</b> The Office of Highway and Safety Planning advises that the backseat is the best place for children 12 and under. Booster seats for ages 4-8, unless they are 4'9" or taller.
<b>Cece Crandall</b> Though the law states what is posted above it does not mean that is the safest for the child. A child of that age and size should still be in a 5 point harness until they reach the limits of the seat and then in a booster with back. Check out The Car seat Lady or Car seats for the littles-
When we know better
We do better
<b>Nikkita Marie</b> Oh I know. I'm just checking for someone else..
<b>Cece Crandall </b> üëå also hoping that my comment helps others who may not know
<b>Nikkita Marie</b> It's only going to help those who actually want to keep their kids safe! Sorry touchy subject for me right now.
<b>Cece Crandall</b> Yes. Very true and it is hard to share car seat safety with others who "know what they are doing" but could be doing it better and safer. Hugs Mama
<b>Nikkita Marie</b> Thanks love. I just don't understand how ppl can't put the safety of their kids first!
<b>Cece Crandall</b> Me either! My little guy was rear facing until 4 1/2 and is still in a 5pt FF at almost 6. I wish everyone watched the car seat crash videos to see why it is so important to know about proper car seat use etc
<b>Shepherd Police Department</b> Great points Cece!
<b>Cece Crandall</b> Shepherd Police Department Thank you</p>
<b>Linda Groat </b>What is a policeman's favorite donut? üòÅ
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Shepherd Police Department</b> I prefer glazed or jelly filled.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Jon Daniels</b> He loves free ones!!!
<b>Shepherd Police Department</b> Very true
<b>Linda Groat </b>I'm thinking you do too Jon. Now get back to work and fix my husband! Lol
<b>Wayne Groat</b> Hubby is all better thanks to Jon. By the way I like chocolate covered. üòä
<b>Linda Groat</b> Jon said no donuts for you Wayne Groat!!</p>
<b>Alexis Holmes</b> Did we meet the goal for the taser videos to be posted?
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Shepherd Police Department</b> We came up $185 short
<b>Alexis Holmes</b> Oh no:(</p>
<b>Ronda Brown Haines</b> Question on the stop sign in front of Joann fabrics store. I see many people not stopping there if no pedestrians are crossing . Or late at night when closed. What's the law on that .
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Niki Zimmer Vollmar</b> Very good question!! I am curious on the law also in pertaining to that.
<b>Lee Aldrich</b> Oh, this is going to be enlightening...
<b>Shepherd Police Department</b> I'll say this...we have no police powers to write a citation in a parking lot....but, if there is an accident the lack of stopping would come into play. Also, we can write people illegally parked in a handicap spot in a parking lot.</p>
<b>Kristen Kiley</b> My son really wants to be a police officer someday. :) what would you recommend he do post high school?
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Shepherd Police Department </b>Most police academies require an associate degree before entering the police academy. Schools like Ferris is a 4 year program. The State Police is always looking for future Troopers too.
<b>Tiffany Smith</b> You could also contact the Michigan State Police in Lansing they have a student stopper camp the students go through a week of boot camp training just as the troopers do. Check with a high school counselor to see if any grants are available to help co...Kristen Kiley Thank you, tiffany!! That's really helpful!
<b>Kara Heugel</b> Delta college has a nice program that my brother and his friend are going through. And being a community college it is much cheaper.</p>
<b>Tom Marley</b> Chief, what was your police academy like? Also, how on Earth did you ever get to be so amazing?
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Shepherd Police Department </b>Tom Marley my academy was great, but this guy was always falling asleep...I think they let him fly helicopters or something now.
<b>Tom Marley</b> Hahaha, that sounds dangerous. Love the page, sir. Your community is very lucky to have you.
<b>Shepherd Police Department</b> Stay safe brother</p>
<b>Rick Mills</b> Let us know any way we can help. Our post was seen by 30,000 and shared 277 times. You'll get her.

<b>Shepherd Police Department</b> Thanks Rick
<b>Andrea Fuller</b> Well said my friend
<b>Patricia L Story</b> Your doing a great job, and your duty, to find the plant snatcher... GOD Bless you for all your time and Hard Work... üëç
<b>Kayla Oaks</b> Hope you find her!!
